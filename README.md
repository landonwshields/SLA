# Superior Learning Academy: A capstone project

I created this website for my mom because she runs her own preschool but is not very good with technology, and I wanted to create something that even she could easily update.

Created with React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Knex.js, PostgresQL, Heroku
